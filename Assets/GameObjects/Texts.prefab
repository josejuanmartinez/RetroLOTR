  gandalf: "Starts with:<br>- Hobbiton <sprite name=\"village\"/><br>- Bilbo <sprite
    name=\"character\"/>( <sprite name=\"diplomat\"/>) <br>- Spells <sprite name=\"mage\"/>and
    Artifacts <sprite name=\"artifact\"/><br>- An unidentified <sprite name=\"ring\"/><br><br>Shrouded
    in robes the color of storm clouds, Gandalf the Grey wanders the realms of Middle-earth
    with ancient staff in hand and wisdom etched upon his weathered face.<br><br>Sent
    by the Valar in an age when darkness threatens to consume the land, this mysterious
    wizard seeks not to confront evil with raw power, but to unite the free peoples
    through counsel and courage.<br><br>From the grand halls of dwarven kingdoms
    to the humble hearths of halfling homes, he moves like mist between worlds, known
    to many as merely a creator of magnificent fireworks, while concealing his true
    purpose \u2013 to guide the most unlikely of heroes against a shadow that would
    devour all light and hope from the world."
  radagast: "Starts with:<br>- Rhosgobel <sprite name=\"hidden\"/> <sprite name=\"camp\"/><br>-
    Spells <sprite name=\"mage\"/> <br><br>Disheveled and nature-bound, Radagast
    the Brown wanders Middle-earth's forests as a guardian of wildlife rather than
    kingdoms.<br><br>With animals following his gentle footsteps and herbs stuffed
    in his pockets, this wizard abandoned the grand politics of his order to heal
    wounded creatures and commune with forest spirits, his apparent distraction from
    the growing darkness masking a deeper wisdom\u2014that preserving Middle-earth's
    very essence might be as crucial to defeating evil as any council of war."
  sauron: "Starts with:<br>- Barad-dur <sprite name=\"camp\"/> <sprite name=\"tower\"/><br>-
    Mouth of Sauron <sprite name=\"character\"/>( <sprite name=\"diplomat\"/>)<br>-
    A low-quality average <sprite name=\"dark\"/>army<br>- Spells <sprite name=\"mage\"/>and
    Artifacts <sprite name=\"artifact\"/><br><br>Sauron the Deceiver once stood as
    the greatest of Morgoth's lieutenants before rising to claim his master's mantle
    of darkness.<br><br>From the shadowed depths of Mordor, this fallen Maia extends
    his will across Middle-earth like a creeping poison, his fair form long abandoned
    for one of nightmare and dread.<br><br>Though diminished after the loss of the
    One Ring, Sauron's essence remains\u2014a lidless eye wreathed in flame, ever-searching,
    patient and cunning beyond mortal comprehension.<br><br>Through whispered promises
    of power and subtle corruption of noble intentions, he works to bind all lands
    to his dominion, not out of mere cruelty, but from a twisted desire to reshape
    creation according to his own perfect and merciless vision of order."
  saruman: "Starts with:<br>- Orthanc <sprite name=\"camp\"/> <sprite name=\"tower\"/><br>-
    Grima <sprite name=\"character\"/>( <sprite name=\"diplomat\"/>)<br>- A low-quality
    small <sprite name=\"neutral\"/> army<br>- Spells <sprite name=\"mage\"/>and
    Artifacts <sprite name=\"artifact\"/><br><br>Saruman the White commands respect
    as the head of the Istari order, his voice as smooth as silk yet powerful as
    thunder.<br><br>From the gleaming tower of Orthanc, this most learned of wizards
    studies ancient lore and the craft of many devices, believing that to defeat
    the enemy, one must understand his methods and tools.<br><br>Though sent as a
    guardian against darkness, Saruman's brilliant mind increasingly turned away
    \u2014 his white robes concealing a heart slowly being consumed by pride and
    ambition as he gazes into forbidden knowledge, convincing himself that Middle-earth
    requires not a servant of the light but a new master to bring order to a chaotic
    world."
